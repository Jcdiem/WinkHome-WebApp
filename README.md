# Wink Home LLC Web Application for Business Management
Simple web app for managing a small business. Made in my free-time.

This project is not internet-facing, and is merely hosted here for showcasing and scrutiny.

## Copying
Do whatever you want with it, but if you find a security flaw just let me know so I can fix it.

## Security
This code is publicly viewable and open to review, so please feel free to suggest improvements or reccomendations on proper procedure.


As long as I can justify it, I plan to keep this project open and a part of my portfiolio.

# Background
A web application built around MySQL and PHP with ui elements and design eventually made in Bootstrap and Jquery.
This project is being built for my current manager at Wink Home LLC. who has to go through hours of paperwork a week to maintain proper community group home standards.
